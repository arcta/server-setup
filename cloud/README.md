# Step 6: Cloud
GCP seems to be the best fit for our projects which are data-heavy ML-enabled applications. Script **gcp.sh** installs [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-linux). (Requireed an account and at least one (may be empty) project.)

Also, **environment** has **floyd-cli** installed [(Floyd)](https://www.floydhub.com/).
